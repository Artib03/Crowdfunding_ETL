# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Please mark the one with my last_name on it. 
Obtained some help from the TLs to complete project. For the default project, I went with option 1 - to parse data using Pandas. 
The exportDBD(2) file contains the code used to create the tables. The crowdfunding_db is in the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file.
